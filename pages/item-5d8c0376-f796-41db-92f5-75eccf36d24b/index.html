Seasons of life are different than seasons of the year but represent themes in the same way. Winter, cold, Christmas, family, togetherness inside. Summer, no school, hot, late nights, catching lightning bugs, family, together outside.</span></p>
<p>Then, in my life, there's hockey season.. so.. every season. But somewhere beyond the seasons our family is in or the perpetual hockey season, there is another season of life I see: my dream. my invention. my legacy.</p>
<p>I will now begin to regularly blog on this platform. Not because of any change in me personally, but because of a change in what our platform is capable of. To understand why it's important to note that I am currently writing to you from a nodeJS version of HAXcms running locally on my machine, let's look quickly at where we've been.</p>

<p>HAX is an idea discussed at a coffee shop among friends. We jot some notes. We go to a sprint, 5 of us I believe, and achieve effectively nothing beyond overwhelming feeling of "wow smart people could do that but we are dumb". The rest of that year and 2016,<span> a few prototypes here and there, basically just to pass the time and entertain myself with the notion of what it could be.</span></p>

<p>The lightning rod moment. Beers in the hotel room, "I'm telling you, you have to look at this". Mike shows me Web components; I immediately extrapolate and know what this means. I start playing around and get an icon to load on screen. My world changes.&#160; We talk about our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGi8n1LAQbg" target="_blank">experiments a few months</a> later.</p>

<p slot="col-1" data-padding="xs" data-margin="s">The messing around turns into abandoning all other projects. The icons become buttons, cards, and rudimentary interfaces for elements that know how to edit other elements. By mid 2018 it's worth showcasing, and you can hear how the coffee and obsession has changed me. I don't just talk fast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq8pt4dyDiw&amp;list=PLJQupiji7J5cPvAknpzjPo1j_kGRs862D&amp;index=2" target="_blank">I talk about something that isn't there</a>. A world that is easy to work with (in my head). I am excited, and have been easily agitated since.</p></grid-plate>

<p>With a renewed focus on usability, HAX jumps ahead by leeps and bounds, mostly because of being assigned a product owner. Bill helps me take HAX to the next level internally and it goes from experiment / neat thing, to us completely abandoning our old way of working and this is the only&#160; way to work going forward</p>

<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-2e015de0-ae6f-500f-8dbd-06d95839f0a0">It's go time</h2>
<p>There's no more time for games. I'm playing for keeps. My goals for the path to 2025, the real, initial time estimate for what it would take to hit a critical inflection point.</p>
<ul><li><span>User stories; success, failures, keep hitting it, keep asking to see how people work and then working to eliminate that process.</span><br></li><li>Keep teaching, keep hosting interns, keep optimizing my process in class so that the course is about learning HAX, and web components as well. Seek to achieve goal of student to production ready code with less than 5 minutes of effort on my part in the end</li><li>DX, DX, DX, DX. Tutorials, optimizing on-boarding.</li><li>UX, UX, UX, UX. Talk to users, see how they use the system, improve their reality, change ours.</li><li>Present. Present. Present. Video, blog, anything and everything. Speak anywhere to any one.</li></ul>
<h2 id="header-020abab9-28ec-9395-5d96-6247ac2e55d4">And just like that</h2>
<p>I go from local development, hit save, and then push this code up and it's built and put on the web via vercel. I am my own publisher, in a developer friendly way but without the confines of the poor authoring provided by developer tools. Using developer workflows, without needing to think about them.</p>
<p>A sustainable, creative pipeline, that I am using for my own writing; that we are using for our documentation and courses (our "core business"). A community being actively built in the classroom to transform the world around us, spreading beyond our use-cases, and gaining adoption.</p>
<p>So now, as there's always more to do, it certainly feels like <b>Go Time</b>.</p>
